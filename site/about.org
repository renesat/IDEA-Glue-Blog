Welcome to my personal blog.
At this moment, I ordinary student from Russia.
My area of interest includes many things.
Mainly this is *OpenSource*, *DeepLearning*, and *Linux*.
My ultimate editor -- *Emacs*.
The best programming languages for me are
*Haskell*, *Lisp* and *Julia* (maybe I try Rust).
I will write my technical posts and workflows on this site.
But sometimes I may write posts about my hobbies
and life.
I hope you will find something interesting here.
