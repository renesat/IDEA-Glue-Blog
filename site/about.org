Welcome to my personal blog.
My area of interest includes many things.
Mainly this is *OpenSource*, *DeepLearning*, and *Linux* (❤️ *Nix*).
My ultimate editor -- +*Emacs*+ *Vim* (trying to learn something new).
The best programming languages for me are
*Rust*, *Haskell*, and *Lisp*. But an expert in *Python* not by choice.
I will write my technical posts and workflows on this site.
But sometimes I may write posts about my hobbies
and life.
I hope you will find something interesting here.
